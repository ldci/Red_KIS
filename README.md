### Red-KIS
Why Red-KIS? Keep It Simple according to Rebol and Red fundamentals! I love the precision and elegance of these languages.

I've developed several professional applications for scientific use (see for example [https://github.com/ldci/Face](https://github.com/ldci/Face) or [https://uniter2p2.fr](https://uniter2p2.fr)) with Red and often wrote little example scripts that I then used in those applications. 

Here are a few examples of the very short line-of-code scripts available to the Red user community.

The code was written for macOS and a few modifications will be necessary for Windows or Linux users (not complicated).
The code is compatible with version 0.65 of Red. Enjoy!
